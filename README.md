Yet another application that came up because of the COVID-19 pandemic.

I am part of a group of people which used to offer free Reiki sessions for the community.
With the demand for social isolation, the only way we could continue to offer our services was doing the sessions remotely.
Basically, this webapp allows users to request Reiki sessions, and Reiki practicioners to see their daily agenda, with the sessions scheduled for them.

Written in a hackaton-ish way, its first version was live within 7 nights of work. A lot of improvements and refactorings came but some sections are still stained with the coffee I spilled on it the late night I wrote it.

Stay safe.
